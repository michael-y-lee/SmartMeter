##Instructions regarding downloading Data Set

The sample_data folder includes a sample of the data required to run the Demo Notebook (SmartMeter_LeeMichael_Demo_Notebook.ipynb).  
The Demo Notebook will not run without downloading the full dataset from Kaggle.
  
Please go to https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london to download the full dataset.

Ensure the “archive” directory is unzipped and stored in the same directory as SmartMeter_Demo_Notebook.ipynb.  

If the "archive directory" is not located in the same directory as SmartMeter_Demo_Notebook.ipynb, 
the user will need to update the paths for the data folders in the “Load in Daily Meter Data” and “Load in Hourly Meter Data” sections of the Demo Notebook.
